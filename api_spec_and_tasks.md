## Required Python third-party packages

- pandas==1.3.3
- scikit-learn==0.24.2
- plotly==5.3.1
- kaleido==0.2.1

## Required Other language third-party packages

- No third-party packages required for other languages.

## Full API spec

No API spec required as the project does not involve frontend-backend interaction.

## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Contains the main entry point of the application. It should initialize DataAnalyzer, Plotter, and FileOperator classes and call their methods in the correct sequence.']
- ['data_analysis.py', 'Contains the DataAnalyzer class. It should implement methods to read data, analyze and cluster it, and create a summary.']
- ['plotting.py', 'Contains the Plotter class. It should implement methods to create a treemap and print it to a file.']
- ['file_operations.py', 'Contains the FileOperator class. It should implement methods to save data to an Excel file.']

## Task list

- data_analysis.py
- plotting.py
- file_operations.py
- main.py

## Shared Knowledge

The 'data_analysis.py' file contains the DataAnalyzer class which is responsible for reading and analyzing the data. The 'plotting.py' file contains the Plotter class which is responsible for creating and printing the treemap. The 'file_operations.py' file contains the FileOperator class which is responsible for saving the data to an Excel file. The 'main.py' file is the main entry point of the application.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear. However, we need to ensure that the team has a good understanding of the Python libraries being used, especially pandas, scikit-learn, plotly, and kaleido.
