## Original Requirements

1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/metagpt/tools_data.xlsx. 2. Analyse the column 'Task Name' such that there are 25 clusters and create a simple summary for each cluster. 3. Present your results as a treemap in plotly. The value should be set by the number of rows in the cluster. The path should be the summary name. 4. Save the data, inc cluster and summary name, to xlsx file. 5. print the plotly treemap to jpg file.

## Product Goals

- Create a tool that can efficiently analyze and cluster data from an Excel file
- Present the results in a visually appealing and understandable format
- Allow the user to save and print the results

## User Stories

- As a data analyst, I want to be able to read and analyze data from an Excel file
- As a data analyst, I want to be able to cluster the data into 25 clusters and create a summary for each cluster
- As a data analyst, I want to present my results in a treemap using plotly
- As a data analyst, I want to save my data, including cluster and summary name, to an Excel file
- As a data analyst, I want to print the plotly treemap to a jpg file

## Competitive Analysis

- Tableau: A powerful data visualization tool, but it may be overkill for this specific task
- Microsoft Excel: Has built-in data analysis tools, but lacks the ability to create treemaps
- Google Sheets: Similar to Excel, but also lacks the ability to create treemaps
- R: A programming language for statistical computing and graphics, but has a steep learning curve
- Python: A general-purpose programming language that can be used for data analysis, but requires coding knowledge

## Requirement Analysis

The product needs to read an Excel file, analyze and cluster the data, present the results in a treemap, and allow the user to save and print the results. The main challenge is to create a user-friendly interface that hides the complexity of the underlying operations.

## Requirement Pool

- ['Read Excel file', 'P0']
- ['Analyze and cluster data', 'P0']
- ['Present results in treemap', 'P0']
- ['Save results to Excel file', 'P1']
- ['Print treemap to jpg file', 'P1']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be simple and intuitive. It should have a 'Load File' button to read the Excel file, a 'Analyze' button to start the analysis, a 'Save' button to save the results, and a 'Print' button to print the treemap. The treemap should be displayed in the center of the screen.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific method for clustering the data is not specified. We will use K-means clustering for simplicity. The 'Task Name' column is assumed to contain numerical data. If it contains categorical data, the clustering method may need to be adjusted.
